#Valour application wrapper rules:

## 1st: Do not harass people, transmit personal data / advertize as in use of bots
this will lead to token invalidation and owner's account will be lead to Valour moderators to futher accout banning / removing [see more here](https://github.com/SpikeViper/Valour/blob/main/PLATFORM_RULES.md)

## 2nd: broadcast messages
bots can be used for this, but just if they follow the first rule

## 3rd: wrapper / api overloading (DoS attacks)
DoS attacks are completly inexcusable and unjustifiable, if one attack is reported it will lead to account ban,
token invalidation and the attack informations will be redirect to legal authorities.

## 4th: spy bots / silent bots:
those bots are used to spy on people, if no one in the server knows about their data is being collected, the token will be 
instantly invalidated and the account redirected to Valour mods
  
  
any questions about the rules can be asked to the wrapper devs in the issues channel, we will be glad to answer!
