            <h1>Basics of Coding with Nautilus</h1>
            <h2>Intro</h2>
            <p>Nautilus is a programming language that is designed to be easy to learn and use.</p>
            <p>We use Google's block coding system, Blockly, for creating easy to understand blocks of code. You have probably seen blocks used before, maybe in Scratch or Microsoft MakeCode.</p>
            <p>Nautilus uses Blockly to create blocks that can be used to create programs that do things like respond to messages, give members roles, or just about anything else you can do in JavaScript.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>What is code?</h2>
            <p>Simply put, coding is used for communicating with computers. People use coding to give computers and other machines instructions on what actions to perform. Further, we use it to program the websites, apps, and other technologies we interact with every day.</p>
            <p>This brings us to the next question: how does coding work?</p>
            <P>The answer is simple:</P>
            <p>You write code.</p>
            <p>You compile the code.</p>
            <p>You run the code.</p>
            <p>It either works, or doesnt. Back to step 1.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>Ok, but how does this tie into Nautilus?</h2>
            <p>As mentioned before, Nautilus uses blocks to code. These blocks are translated to JavaScript, just like how you can translate English to French.</p>
            <p>The JavaScript code is then run on the computer. The computer then does what the JavaScript code says it should do.</p>
            <p>This is the same process that we use to write code in our apps, websites, and other technologies. Except most of these don't use blocks.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>Right ok, makes sense, can I start now?</h2>
            <p>Yes, you can start coding right now!</p>
