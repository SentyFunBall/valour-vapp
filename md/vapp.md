VAPP is a coding lauguage designed to be easy, and fun. (more later)

# How to use Valour VAPP
## The IDE
### Installation
First things first, you want to install the Nautilus Code IDE, our custom built IDE just for making the code blocks. Download it at [link here](), and run the nautilus.exe program.

### How to use the IDE
First, click on "New project". This will open up the block editor, a modified version of Google's Blockly. Then build your code. After that, click run. It will run the code you created.
