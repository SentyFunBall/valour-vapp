            <h1>Basics of Coding - Functions</h1>
            <h2>Functions</h2>
            <p>Functions are a way to group code together. They are used to make code easier to read and understand. Functions are also used to make code more efficient. Functions are also used to make code more readable.</p>
            <h2>Where should they be used?</h2>
            <p>A function should be used in a variety of places. They are most useful when a large chunk of code needs to be ran multiple times. For example, a chunk of code that creates a list of all the members in a server could be condensed into a funcion.</p>
            <p>Another example of when functions should be used is when you want to make code easier to read. If you have a large section of code that checks if a message meets several predefined commands, you can tell the commands to run as a function instead of in the checking part of the code.</p>
