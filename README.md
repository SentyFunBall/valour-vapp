# Valour VAPP

Valour VAPP: The community built block coding language for Valour. https://discord.gg/BZmH2tu9gB

# Notice:
Valour VAPP, Nautilus and VAPP are currently in a development hold while we wait for Valour to reach a more user friendly, active state.
We may add Discord.JS support later in the year, join our [our discord](https://discord.gg/BZmH2tu9gB) for updates on Valour Vapp.

Valour is an open-source, modern chat client which focuses on privacy and security while implementing features that bring it beyond the norm.

Valour VAPP is a community built, open source way to build bots for Valour. Using a custom built block coding language, almost anyone can build a bot now. The system is still in development, and will be released soon after Valour first release.
