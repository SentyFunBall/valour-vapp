            About Valour Applications and the developers:
        </h1>
		
		<h2>
			Who are we?
		</h2>
		
		<p>
			The VAPP Project was started because there hasn't been a way to make bots for Valour. Senty had the idea to have an "Extensions" system, and that morphed over time into Nautilus, VAPP, and everything else in the VAPP Project.
