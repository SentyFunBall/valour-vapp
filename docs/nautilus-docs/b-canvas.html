            <h1>Block editor</h1>
            <p>The block editor is where you will spend most of your time, as this is where blocks can be put together to create functional code. Using blocks is just like normal coding, but without most user-created errors, like syntax or uncaught type errors.</p>
            <h2>Block selection menu</h2>

            <p>The block selection menu (seen above) is located on the left side of the window when in the block editor, and shows all the blocks that exist, in neat categories.</p>
            <h2>Canvas</h2>

            <p>The canvas is where the program is displayed. All of your blocks are displayed here. You can interact with them with your mouse and keyboard. Drag on any empty space on the canvas to move it. Everything is on a grid to keep everything nice and tidy. Drag block(s) to the trash can to delete them. Click on the can to retrieve blocks at a later date. (seen below)</p>
