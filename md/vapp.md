# What is Valour VAPP?
## About
Valour VAPP is a way to create bots for Valour. Using simple drag-and-drop coding blocks (like Scratch!), you can build a basic bot in less than 5 minutes. .vapp files are our own files, used for building bots. 

## Design
VAPP is a coding lauguage designed to be easy, and fun. (more later)

# How to use Valour VAPP
## The IDE
### Installation
First things first, you want to install the Nautilus Code IDE, our custom built IDE just for making the code blocks. Download it at (link here), and run the nautilus.exe program.

### How to use the IDE
First, click on "New bot". This will open up the block editor, a modified version of Google's Blockly. Then build your code. After that, save your file. It will be saved as a .vapp for the IDE to read, and as .js for Valour.

## The Interpreter
### How to use it
In the IDE, click on "Start bot". This will start your code. The IDE will transfer the .js to the intpreter, which will run the code and convert the results back to the IDE, and then back to the IDE. Nautilus will then send it to Valour, as requests come in from Valour.
