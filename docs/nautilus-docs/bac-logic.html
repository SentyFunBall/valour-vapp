            <h1>Basics of Coding - Logic</h1>
            <h2>Logic</h2>
            <p>
                <strong>Logic</strong> is the process of deciding what to do based on the information you have.
            </p>
            <h3>What is logic?</h3>
            <p>Boolean logic, shortened to just "logic" here, are stored as either On or Off in memory. True or False. 0 or 1.</p>
            <p>Computers can decide weather or not to do something based on if the logic is true or false. For example, if your age is less than 10, you get the ice cream for free. Otherwise, the ice cream costs $10.</p>
            <p>There are several operators when dealing with logic: AND, OR and NOT. These can be used to combine logic statements to allow for more conditionality.</p>
            <p>Example: if your age is less than 19 AND your age is greater than 10, the ice cream costs $5. The ice cream will only be $5 if your age is between 11 and 18.</p>
            <p>There are a few more operators as well: Less than, greater than, and equal to.</p>
            <p>Less than is true if A is less than B (10 is less than 15). If A is not less than B, the statement will be false (15 is less than 10)</p>
            <p>Greater than is true if A is greater than B (15 is greater than 10). If A is not greater than B, the statement will be false (10 is greater than 15)</p>
            <p>Equal to is true if A is equal to B (10 is equal to 10). If A is not equal to B, the statement will be false (10 is equal to 15)</p>
            <h2>Logic in Nautilus</h2>
            <p>In Nautilus, all of the explained logic conditions exist. There is a single block for comparing two things.</p>

            <p>The <code>=</code> block can be configured for less than, greater than and NOT equal as well.</p>
